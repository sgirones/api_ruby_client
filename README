=Abiquo API Ruby client

Rest client to work with the Abiquo's API.

==Installation

gem install abiquo

==Usage

The first version of the api just uses basic authentication, so we need to create an instance with our credentials:

  auth = Abiquo::BasicAuth.new('Abiquo', 'username', 'password')

The entry point for the Abiquo's API is an atom document service:

  api = Abiquo::Resource('http://abiquo.example.com/api', auth)

from this point we can access to every resource exposed by the api calling nested methods:

  datacenters = api.datacenters
  racks = api.datacenters.first.racks

or get the values of their elements:

  datacenter = api.datacenters.first
  datacenter.name  # => The name of the datacenter

You can find further example into the specs:
